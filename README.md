- Generate singing audio from text
- Support web and mobile clients

## System Architecture
Client (Web/Mobile) → REST API → AI Engine → Local Storage

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React
- Mobile: Android (Kotlin)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- AI: YOLOv8, OCR, DiffSinger
- Database: MongoDB (metadata)
- Storage: Local file system

## Development Methodology
Agile SDLC with incremental sprints.

## Current Status
Project initialization and planning phase.
